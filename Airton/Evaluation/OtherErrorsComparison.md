### Machine Learning Techniques for Short-Term Rain Forecasting System in the Northeastern Part of Thailand

Error: <br/>
The results achieved in 68.15% and 69.10% of overall accuracy of same-day prediction for the ANN and SVM models, respectively. <br/>

Summary:<br/>
The literature Machine Learning Techniques for Short-Term Rain Forecasting System in the Northeastern Part of Thailand, 
talks about using Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine to develop classification and prediction
models for rainfall forecasts. In the literature it was shown how feature selection could be used to identify the relationships
between rainfall occurrences and what models can be created and used for predicting accurate rainfall. The literature gave 
insight of the different machine learning used and comparing them with RMSE to see which one has a better result

### Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting

Error:<br/>
0.908 correlation <br/>

Summary:<br/>
Nowcasting convective precipitation has long been an important problem in the field of weather forecasting. 
The goal of this task is to give precise and timely prediction of rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short 
period of time (e.g., 0-6 hours). The goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local 
region over a relatively short period of time. In the paper, they formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal
sequence forecasting problem in which the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending 
the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions,
they created the LSTM. <br/>
