## Goals achieved from last week
Goal #1:
Perform Time series analysis of Mean Bias Error(MBE) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) for PIX2PIX run2 results. ("Run2" basically is the term Model team and Evalution team is using for the 2nd wave. Here, run2 is differnt from run1 due the processed radar images that Rex proposed. Sami trained the model, I evaluated the images just like run1. I also reformatted evaluation report's structure in jupyter-notebook by making it cleaner and by adding more visuals.

Goal #2:
Installed CUDA and Tensorflow on my Ubuntu machine. This will further allow me to work on the code independently without dealing with restrictions imposed on school servers. Got access to tensorboard files generated in run1 and run2.
