S. Specific
For this week, I will work on creating and documenting python modules that would contain all the inclusive functions associated with techniques to measure and validate the estimation of precipitation. The functions would include indices like Mean Bias Error (MBE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Variation of the RMSE (CV-RMSE), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Probability of
Detection(POD), and False alarm ratio(FAR). I will also create a example ipython-notebook that will showcase the functions.

M. Measurable
On successful completion of this goal, the team will have 1 python module that would allow it to import and then call functions directly in ipython-notebook or python scripts. The additional example jupyter-notebook will showcase how to import the module and utilize it.

A. Achievable
Functions can be easily written and tested. The motivation of this task is to modularize the functions and avoid repitions in the code. This will also allow sharing and maintainability of the code. 

R. Succesful creation of the module will allow other team members to collabrate on the code. e.g. Some one suggest a code in to be put in the module, and he/she will know exactly where to find it.

T. Time-bound:
The deadline for this task is anticipated to be 9/11/2018. This task can be completed witih in 1 week.

Perform Time series analysis of Bias Error(MBE) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)  for PIX2PIX results


Stretch Goal# 1
For Week1, we aim to practice one complete cycle of the workflow suggested in the workflow in a collaborative fashion. Rex will collect, clean, and transform the data. Yuan and Sami will run certain models. I will test and evaluate the models and research how the models can be improved by means of changing the model parameters or input data.
