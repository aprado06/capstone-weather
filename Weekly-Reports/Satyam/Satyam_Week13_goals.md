# Stretch Goal#1
After meeting with Brian and Prof. Grossberg, it was found that there is a fundamental error in my Inputs. I did investigation of the whole pipeline from the inputs to the visualization of the generated images and found that some that Rex gave me are Y-axis inverted. This led to re-training, re-testing, re-Visualizing of everymodel I had evaluated for the last month with NPY all over again. 

Achieved Goals:

## Goal #1:
Performed successful investigation and was able to diagnose the problem

## Goal #2
Rewrote, Retrained, Retested, and ReVisualized the output for:

#### Linear Regression: 1x1 window Satellite and Model in NPY
#### Linear Regression: 3x3 window Satellite and Model in NPY
#### Linear Regression: 5x5 window Satellite and Model in NPY

#### Random Forest Regression: 1x1 window Satellite and Model in NPY
#### Random Forest Regression: 3x3 window Satellite and Model in NPY
#### Random Forest Regression: 5x5 window Satellite and Model in NPY


## Goal #3
Added code for much awaited *ROC Curve* and SSIM
