## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
Fill in

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
Fill in (this should be crisp like implment a specific function, produce a notebook with certain graphs, etc. If it is not something
obvious to me how I would grade success, partial sucess and failure, then you lose points.)

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
Fill in

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
Fill in


#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
Fill in (next week)
