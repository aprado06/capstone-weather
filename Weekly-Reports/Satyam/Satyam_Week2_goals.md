Stretch Goal 1:
This week I will focus on understanding the pix2pix code and running the tensorflow code on my machine. Pixel to pixel mapping has been a strong candidate for estimating precipitation over land. However, the pix2pix have performed really well at the cost of low interpretability of its black-box representation. I will dive into the code and better understand how its architechture is set up. It is relevant as it will help me better asist my peers on suggesting changes in the model and better evaluation the evaluations.
