Stretch Goal 1:
This week I will focus on understanding the pix2pix code and running the tensorflow code on my machine. Pixel to pixel mapping has been a strong candidate for estimating precipitation over land. However, the pix2pix have performed really well at the cost of low interpretability of its black-box representation. I will dive into the code and better understand how its architechture is set up. It is relevant as it will help me better asist my peers on suggesting changes in the model and better evaluation the evaluations.

Smart Goal #1:

S.Specific
Perform Time series analysis of Mean Bias Error(MBE) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) for PIX2PIX run2 results. ("Run2" basically is the term Model team and Evalution team is using for the 2nd wave. Each "run" is the data that were manipulated in some form by changinng the channel or feature)

M. Measurable
Performing a Time analysis of errors will result in 2 linecharts for Mean Bias Error(MBE) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) for the year 2017. Like last week's smart goal, this will also result in a sequsence of numbers representing the perfoemnca of the estimation oacross the year.

A. Achievable
This is a doable task and does not require additional research. The module required is already written as part of the last week goal. Most of the  is finished will be mainly used in this task.

R. Relevent
run1 is the first generated prediction of radar data from pix2pix. In the past, Error matrics were only performed between two images. Line chart will allow comaprison and perfomances of metrices in realtion to different weather states of the region of interest

T. Time-bound:
The deadline for this task is anticipated to be 9/18/2018. This task should be completed witih in 1 week.
