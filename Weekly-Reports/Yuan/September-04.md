## Weekly Report:
#### SMART Goals

##### SMART GOAL 1
The first goal of the week is to document the linear regression model I made last semester. This includes the manipulation of the data before it gets used by the model. The result of this goal will be jupyter notebook file that describes every decision made. I use Github as a place to push my documents, so that the master repo can be updated with my linear regression model and it's documents. This is relevatnt to the project because the linear regression mode aims to solve the goal of our senior design project. This model aims to transform satellite images to radar images, therefore documentaion is extremly important not only for me but for other team memebers as well.
