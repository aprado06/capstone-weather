## Weekly Report:
#### SMART Goals

##### SMART GOAL 1
The first goal of the week is to document the linear regression model I made last semester. This includes the manipulation of the data before it gets used by the model. The result of this goal will be jupyter notebook file that describes every decision made. I use Github as a place to push my documents, so that the master repo can be updated with my linear regression model and it's documents. This is relevatnt to the project because the linear regression mode aims to solve the goal of our senior design project. This model aims to transform satellite images to radar images, therefore documentaion is extremly important not only for me but for other team memebers as well. 

##### SMART GOAL 2
The second goal of the week is to obtain data retrieved from PERSIANN algorithm. Those values will be the estimate rainfall values from infared images, and they are available in 30 minute intervals, 1 hour intervals, all the way to yearly intervals. This goal will result in having PERSIANN rainfall values either on personal laptop or the computers in CCNY. I will also have jupyter notebooks to visualize the data from PERSIANN. The data is attainable from `http://chrsdata.eng.uci.edu/`, so it can be downloaded to be visualized. This data can be useful interms of trainning the linear regression model, since this is the rainfall values from infared images. This would be done before the next meeting.

##### SMART GOAL 
The third goal of the week is to visualize the data given. I will use the same visualization color scheme used on the radar visualizations. This will result in visuals in a jupyter notebook that has visuals of yearly rain rates, and comparisons of satellite, radar, and PERSIANN data. Since they numeric rain fall values, they can be displayed through graphs and be visualized along with geolocations. This is relevant to the project because it helps to compare the results between satellite, radar, and the persiann data that ppredicts the the rainfall data from infared images. This will be done by the next meeting.
