# Smart and Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to ahve the overall understanding in how the algorithm is working because every smart goal basically goes into a small part of the whole algorithm. 


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Now that I got tensorflow last week and was able to run a the mnist tutorial and started to change it the outputs would be given in the terminal but the tensorboard connection was not established. So my first smart goal is to fix it and have the results shown on tensorboard.

#### M. Measurable: 
Can create a notebook that shows the output of tensorboard working. 

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the basic skills of running the program but need more which can be obtained with more exposure . The motivation is that this continues my growing knowledge on tensorboard which is essential in the algorithm to see whats happening. 

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since it ties with the overall project/ algorithm that sami is working with which uses tensorfow and the tensorboard.


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
After being able to run/connect the tensorboard with the small test in goal one, I can move to using the tensorboard on the pix2pix algorithm and be able to do show one/ more runs. Also can change some of the inputs to see the changes. 

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I can clearly show the tensorboard in a markdown file. 

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes I will have the skills to do this since it will be learned in smart goal 1 of this week. 


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it gives me more insight of how the tensorboard works which I will be using a lot.  


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
I can create a Markdown file explaining in great detail about how the tensorbard works and what is shows based on the algorithm.

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measureable because a document will be created that shows the work done.

#### A. Achievable: 
I do have the skills for this goal.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because for some of the group members who will not work with the tensorboard, it will give them the insight so that they are not confused when seeing it. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

I was able to complete Goal #3 which took me a day since for some reason my terminal/computer had many settings
that had to be changed in order to let me ssh into the servers that were given to us to use. I was able to coonect to the
servers and be able to see everything that was in it. <br/>

For Goal #1 I didn't look into the loss function and the inner workings of the algorithm instead i decided to change it 
nto getting tensorflow and be able to run tensorboard in my computer since tensorboard is a vital thing for the algorithm 
since it shows a lot of the data. I was able to get tensorflow and run a small deep leaning algorithm in it, but I had trouble connecting it t the tensorboard in order to display it. So I achieved half of the new goal and have made getting the 
tensorboard to work one of my new goals for this week.<br/>

For Goal #2 I got the code to work for RSME to work but since Satyam decided to work on this as well I decided to 
not focus on this so much so we don't end up doing the same work and focused more on the tensorboard. <br/>
