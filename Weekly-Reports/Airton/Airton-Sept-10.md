# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado
**Date:** 9/11/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to ahve the overall understanding in how the algorithm is working because every smart goal basically goes into a small part of the whole algorithm 


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Continue learning more in depth on the algorithms features/ code like the loss function because it will be a vital change that I can improve in order to make sure that we are not making the code worse. 

#### M. Measurable: 
When running the program we can get graphs of the lose function, so I can create a notebook that details whats is happening and have garphs from it showing. 

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the basic skills of running the program but need more which can be obtained. The motivation is that this continues my growing knowledge on the algorithm so that I will be able to evaluate it. 

#### R. Relevant :
Setting this goal now since last week I started to get the basic knolwdge of the algorithm and now I can go more in depth. Its relevant since it ties with the overall project.


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
Compare the new output run1 with the old one from last semester and see the feature that is helping/not. 

#### M. Measurable: 
Running the error evaluation on the images will give me a quantity that I can record in a markdown file. In addition i can put it in graph comparisons.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes I have the skills to do this and the motivation is that although last week I started motifying the code I got errors that still needed to be fixed which can be done in this week. 


#### R. Relevant :
Setting this goal now because it is a continuation of last weeks goals which although I got work done for it still needed more improvements.  


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Since the pix2pix is running on the servers now I have to familiarize myself in running the evaluation code on the servers since I have been working with it only loacally i need to be able to do it on the servers especially since i was getting errors trying to connect.

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measureable because I can create a document that shows screenshots of my work in the servers. In addition I can add a file in it as proof as well.   

#### A. Achievable: 
I do not have the skills since I kept getting errors when I initially tried but can easily learn the skills in the span of a week. 

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because when we have big runs we will be doing everything mostly through the servers and I should be able to  get to them for when I have to add my work.


#### T. Time-bound: 
(Whatâ€™s the deadline and is it realistic?)
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

I was able to complete SMART GOAL #1 since it was me understanding how the algorithm code work and I broke it down into a simple way of explaining it<br/>

I was able to complete half of SMART GOAL #2 since I started to mess with the RSME code but got errors because my data got messed up so in the file I have the code that I started to work with but needs improvements which tie into next weeks goals<br/>
https://github.com/yuanzhou15/capstone-weather/blob/master/Airton/Evaluation/RSME.ipynb

I wasn't able to complete SMART GOAL #3 because the error evaluation in goal 2 was not completed. Instead I added another goal that was not a part of my officially written one in which I went through papers that I have read and started to mark down their errors and can potentially add a summary.<br/>
