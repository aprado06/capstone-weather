# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado
**Date:** 9/24/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to ahve the overall understanding in how the algorithm is working because every smart goal basically goes into a small part of the whole algorithm. 


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Now that I got tensorflow connections working I am trying to decipher the graphs that are shown and connecting them to each variable to get its meaning.

#### M. Measurable: 
Can create a notebook that shows the meaning of the graphs in deatail. 

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the basic skills of running the program but need more which can be obtained with more exposure . The motivation is that this continues my growing knowledge on tensorboard which is essential in the algorithm to see whats happening. 

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since it ties with the overall project/ algorithm that sami is working which uses tensorfow, the tensorboard and I need to be able to detect the changes that occur based on the graphs.


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
Read through the links that Professor Grossberg sent us in order to get knowledge of the error matrics/ other useful tools. 

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I can clearly show in a markdown file and try out new tools that are talked about. 

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes I will have the skills to do this since it will be learned in smart goal 1 of this week. 


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it gives me more insight of how the tensorboard works which I will be using a lot.  


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Fix errors that have appeared on my configs that are creating many bypasses that I have to use.

#### M. Measurable: 
This is might not be measureable since I can't really show but its necessary since it needs to be fixed in order to be able to continue my having my future work shown.

#### A. Achievable: 
I do have the skills for this goal and just need to research it more.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because I need to be able to show my work and this is essential. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

I was able to complete Goal #1 which was to get the tensorboard showing and working for the mnist tutorial and was able to see the graphs of the accuracy, cross entropy, layer 1 and 2 all displayed on the tensorboard. <br/>

For Goal #2 I was able to start displaying the tensorboard for pix2pix but still need to decipher the graphs better and understand their meaning.<br/>

For Goal #3 I was able to write a small explanation of how the connection works for the tensorboard which is what I was struggling with since I messed up the logdir. This is also included in the link from goal 1 as well.. <br/>
