#  SMART GOALS

#Smart Goal #1: <br/> Get algorithm used in last semester's run and familirize with it in order to be able to know how it works and to be able to find improvement. This is measurable because once all the code is gotten we can see if I can run it and could create a demo/document highlighting what the code does. This is doable since we have the algorithm from last semester. This is relevant because it will give me more insight of the allgorithm used and will be the starting point of what I will be working with. There is a week of time to accomplish this. <br/>

#Smart Goal #2: <br/> After becoming familiar with the algorithm code I can start running error metrics like RSME on it and compare it to the RMSE of the paper Short term rain forecasting in northern Thailand as a benchmark. It’s measurable because the comparisons can be shown graphically/ with images.  Its doable because we have the data of the errors in the paper and then the other errors will come from the work in my first smart goal. The goal is relevant because in order to make sure our work is significant we will need benchmarks to check with and compare so starting to do that now will give me more exposure to doing that. There is a week of time to accomplish this. <br/> 

#Smart Goal #3: <br/> Look more in depth in how the input was used in the algorithm in order to notice improvements that can be done like finding a better way to input the data. This is measurable since I can write down a doc of what the input is doing throughout the algorithm and can start looking if any of the data is not collaborating with the results. This is doable since we have the data already from last semester so now I just have to look more in depth into it. It’s relevant to the project because its manipulating the algorithm and data we are going to use and we have to make sure its heading the right way in order to make imrovements to it. Have the week to get this done.  <br/>


# STRECH GOAL

#Strech Goal: <br/>  After looking more in depth at the algorithm and getting down some of the errors I can start creating a basic benchmark that we can use as our starting point that will tell us if we are making improvements as we head onand continue making more progress. This is relevant because it creates a numeric base that we can use for our project in the future. This can hopefully be done in a few weeks<br/>
