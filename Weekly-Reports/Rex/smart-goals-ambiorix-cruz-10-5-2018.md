# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Ambiorix Cruz Angeles
**Date:** 10/5/2018

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Being able to complete one full pipeline from the Feature Team -> Algorithm Team -> Evaluation Team. To be specific, creating a "control" model for comparison between future models. The result of this effort will be shown in the groups documentation file. A table of some sort listing all the future models, including this base model, will be made to keep track of important notes from each model. This is obtainable if everyone in the group puts forth there best effort when it's their teams turn to take over the current model being produced. This is relevant to our project because if we can get into a nice routine, the rest would just be changing the inputs and getting outputs.

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

1. Generating the rest of the 20 hours from each dataset for sami's pix2pix
2. Adding on more information to the feature teams wiki page
3. Rsyncing and sshing the new hours onto wproj

Week 6- S.M.A.R.T.- Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timebound

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific:
Extracting the other 20 hours out of every data set instead of the test of 4/day.

#### M. Measurable: 
The result of this effort will be shown by a jupyter notebook titled “rex/satellite.ipynb”, “rex/radar.ipynb”, and “rex/model.ipynb” in the master repo. Commits will be done as often as I can remember so the progress can be tracked on github.

#### A. Achievable:
This is achievable using pythons matplotlib, pillow, numpy, and basemap library. 

#### R. Relevant:
Our project consists of training multiple supervised learning models to accurately produce radar data with satellite images and model data as input. Getting more correlating hours between all of our data sets means the models trained by sami and yuan will be more generalized throughout the day.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 10/14/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:
Adding the current findings and information to the feature teams wiki page

#### M. Measurable:
The result of this effort will be shown by a wiki page titled "feature team" in the master repo. 

#### A. Achievable:
It is possible for me to achieve this because all I have to do is add onto the wiki page any interesting finds and the hdd structure.

#### R. Relevant:
Documentation is key incase something goes wrong or the future me would like to go back and look over old code or certain aspects of this project. The more organized we are now, the easier of a time the future me will have.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 10/14/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific:
Append the new hours generated from smart goal 1 between radar, model, and satellite to the scratch/final/A and scratch/final/B in wproj

#### M. Measurable:
The result of this effort will be shown by a the folders scratch/final/A and scratch/final/B in the wproj node

#### A. Achievable:
All of the images have to created and it's just a matter of properly rsyncing and sshing.

#### R. Relevant:
Furthers sami's pix2pix model progression as well as our progress toward our stretch goal.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 10/14/2018 

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

Smart Goal #1- "Extracting satellite band 3, 4, and 6 for sami" notebook: https://github.com/yuanzhou15/capstone-weather/rex/satellite.ipynb
