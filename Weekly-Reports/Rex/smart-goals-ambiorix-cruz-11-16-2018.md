# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Ambiorix Cruz Angeles

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Being able to complete one full pipeline from the Feature Team -> Algorithm Team -> Evaluation Team. To be specific, creating a "control" model for comparison between future models. The result of this effort will be shown in the groups documentation file. A table of some sort listing all the future models, including this base model, will be made to keep track of important notes from each model. This is obtainable if everyone in the group puts forth there best effort when it's their teams turn to take over the current model being produced. This is relevant to our project because if we can get into a nice routine, the rest would just be changing the inputs and getting outputs.
Update: We have completed our stretch goal. Now all we have to do is compare and contrast different trained models.


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

1. Talking with Sami so we can email Brian for a possible meetup.

2. Rsyncing the numpy files for satyam.

3. Trying to help yuan with her vid2vid error.

Week 12- S.M.A.R.T.- Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timebound

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific:
Emailing brian about a possible meetup after the thanksgiving break.

#### M. Measurable: 
An email-chat was sent and everyone was cc'd.

#### A. Achievable:
It's just an email.

#### R. Relevant:
Meeting with Brian can give us useful insight on everything we are doing.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/25/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:
Satyam would like it if I rsync'd the numpy data for him onto the wproj node so he can portforward a notebook into it and work with it on the super computer.

#### M. Measurable:
The data can be found in a ~/scratch/satyam on the wproj computer

#### A. Achievable:
I have rsync'd data before from home by sshing into a computer in the linux lab and rsyncing the data onto it. Then, from tht computer down to the wproj computer.

#### R. Relevant:
Feature importance can help us figure out what is worth training pix2pix with.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/25/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific:
Yuan is having a ton of trouble with vid2vid and asked the team for help. I was thinking of creating a virtual machine on my desktop tailored to run vid2vid specifically.

#### M. Measurable:
This is hard to measure since it's mainly reading up on vid2vid and creating a virtual machine and installing stuff for vid2vid

#### A. Achievable:
Not sure if it is possible to install vid2vid and run it from my home desktop seeing as Yuan tried on colab and it didn't work.

#### R. Relevant:
Getting vid2vid to work would help us create a model that takes into consideration the hour before and the hour after of the image it is currently being trained on

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/25/2018
