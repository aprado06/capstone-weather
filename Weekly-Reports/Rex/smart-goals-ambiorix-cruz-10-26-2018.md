# Smart and Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Being able to complete one full pipeline from the Feature Team -> Algorithm Team -> Evaluation Team. To be specific, creating a "control" model for comparison between future models. The result of this effort will be shown in the groups documentation file. A table of some sort listing all the future models, including this base model, will be made to keep track of important notes from each model. This is obtainable if everyone in the group puts forth there best effort when it's their teams turn to take over the current model being produced. This is relevant to our project because if we can get into a nice routine, the rest would just be changing the inputs and getting outputs.
Update: We have completed our stretch goal. Now all we have to do is compare and contrast different trained models.


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

1. Created the first model "Sparseless"
2. Helping yuan with her memory leak error by resizing the images
3. Gave satyam his entire new data set to srun the data on.

Week 9- S.M.A.R.T.- Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timebound

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific:
Created the first model- sparsless. If the radar images are too black, the discard.

#### M. Measurable: 
Sub sampling the data set and issuing it to sami onto wproj will showcase the results.

#### A. Achievable:
The routine is there, just need new relevant data

#### R. Relevant:
Less sparse images = more accurate and generalized pix2pix model

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/4/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:
Reducing the size of yuans data from 5 bands to 1 band and radar. As well as, reducing the image size from 256x256 to 256x128.

#### M. Measurable:
The efforts of this will be portrayed in the "vid2vid.ipynb" file in the master repo.

#### A. Achievable:
The pillow library allows you to easily resize images.

#### R. Relevant:
We need to get vid2vid to start working since the semester is almost over.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/4/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific:
EMailed Satyam his own dataset containing 1411 instances of data that correlates.

#### M. Measurable:
The result of this effort will be shown by a jupyter notebook titled "satyam.rad_sat_mod.ipynb"

#### A. Achievable:
rsycning, sshing, and emailing is everything that has been done before.

#### R. Relevant:
Feature importance over all data is important to note how bad or good our combinations of the dataset can be.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/4/2018
