# Smart and Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Being able to complete one full pipeline from the Feature Team -> Algorithm Team -> Evaluation Team. To be specific, creating a "control" model for comparison between future models. The result of this effort will be shown in the groups documentation file. A table of some sort listing all the future models, including this base model, will be made to keep track of important notes from each model. This is obtainable if everyone in the group puts forth there best effort when it's their teams turn to take over the current model being produced. This is relevant to our project because if we can get into a nice routine, the rest would just be changing the inputs and getting outputs.

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

1. Giving Satyam the model data feautres
2. Rsyncing new data for sami onto the wproj
3. Messing around with edge detection like canny edge detector

Week 8- S.M.A.R.T.- Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timebound

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific:
Give satyam the model data images so he can re run his feature importance algorithm to determine which features are relevant.

#### M. Measurable: 
The result of this effort will be shown by a jupyter notebook titled “rex/rad_sat_mod.ipynb” in the master repo. Commits will be done as often as I can remember so the progress can be tracked on github.

#### A. Achievable:
This is achievable because the filenames retain information about the time and date each data was recorded. It's just a matter of lining up a list of filenames properly.

#### R. Relevant:
Our project consists of training multiple supervised learning models to accurately produce radar data with satellite images and model data as input. Satyams feature importance can greatly help this team and the algorithms we are trying to train.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/4/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:
Sami is back and would like the new dataset to be rysnc'd onto wproj so he can begin training

#### M. Measurable:
The efforts of this will be portrayed in the "scratch/sparselss" file in the wproj node.

#### A. Achievable:
I've already extracted images for sami, so rsyncing them is just a regular task now.

#### R. Relevant:
Sami needs the images to work on wproj so he can train the models.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/4/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific:
Trying out edge detection algorithms to see if those are worth feeding into pix2pix

#### M. Measurable:
The result of this effort will be shown by a jupyter notebook titled "feature-extract.ipynb"

#### A. Achievable:
I've taken a computer vision course and am familiar with canny edge detection.

#### R. Relevant:
More feature = more data

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/4/2018
