# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Ambiorix Cruz Angeles

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Being able to complete one full pipeline from the Feature Team -> Algorithm Team -> Evaluation Team. To be specific, creating a "control" model for comparison between future models. The result of this effort will be shown in the groups documentation file. A table of some sort listing all the future models, including this base model, will be made to keep track of important notes from each model. This is obtainable if everyone in the group puts forth there best effort when it's their teams turn to take over the current model being produced. This is relevant to our project because if we can get into a nice routine, the rest would just be changing the inputs and getting outputs.

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

1. Yuan's sequential folders
2. Satyam's random forrest feature importance dataset
3. Updating the wiki page!

Week 8- S.M.A.R.T.- Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timebound

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific:
Yuan's vid2vid requires images to be in seperate sequential folders. Each folder has to contain a sequence of images with no gaps.

#### M. Measurable: 
The result of this effort will be shown by a jupyter notebook titled “rex/vid2vid.ipynb” in the master repo. Commits will be done as often as I can remember so the progress can be tracked on github. The idea is to create a folder A with sequential 000, 001, 002, etc fodlers containing long sequences of data. Same goes for B.

#### A. Achievable:
This is achievable because the filenames retain information about the time and date each data was recorded. It's just a matter of lining up a list of filenames properly.

#### R. Relevant:
Our project consists of training multiple supervised learning models to accurately produce radar data with satellite images and model data as input. Vid2vid takes into account data before and after a giving picture instance. Further "smoothing" outputs.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 10/28/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:
Satyam asked me if I could start lending him some data so he could start getting his hands dirty with some sci-kit learn stuff.

#### M. Measurable:
The efforts of this will be portrayed in the "rad_sat.ipynb" and the "rad_sat_mod.ipynb" within the rex folder of the github master repo.

#### A. Achievable:
I've already extracted images for sami and yuan, so extracting images for satyam shouldn't be a problem.

#### R. Relevant:
He will be running feature importance algorithms to determine what features work best for our particular model.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 10/28/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific:
Update the wiki page!

#### M. Measurable:
The result of this effort will be shown by a wiki page on the master repo titled feature team.

#### A. Achievable:
The wiki page was already created and updating it isn't that hard.

#### R. Relevant:
Incase someone would like to dive deep into what we achieved or if I ever need to go back to review some aspects of the project.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 10/21/2018
