# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Ambiorix Cruz Angeles
**Date:** 11/2/2018

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Being able to complete one full pipeline from the Feature Team -> Algorithm Team -> Evaluation Team. To be specific, creating a "control" model for comparison between future models. The result of this effort will be shown in the groups documentation file. A table of some sort listing all the future models, including this base model, will be made to keep track of important notes from each model. This is obtainable if everyone in the group puts forth there best effort when it's their teams turn to take over the current model being produced. This is relevant to our project because if we can get into a nice routine, the rest would just be changing the inputs and getting outputs.
Update: We have completed our stretch goal. Now all we have to do is compare and contrast different trained models.


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

1. Experimenting with sci-kit images canny edge detection.
2. Managing all of the datasets from sami, yuan, and satyam.
3. Updating the Feature Team Wiki Page!

Week 10- S.M.A.R.T.- Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timebound

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific:
Creating an edge map of all the input features to see if they are worth inputting into a model made by pix2pix.

#### M. Measurable: 
The efforts of this adventure can be measured by the amount of code written in a jupyter notebook titled "edge-detection" in the rex subfolder of the master repository.

#### A. Achievable:
All of the data is available to me and there is plenty of documentation about creating edge maps of an image using sci-kit learns image edge detection functions and features.

#### R. Relevant:
Possibly create more data we can feed into a model for training.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/11/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:
Communication is key to moving this project forward. The dataset between sami, yuan, and satyam has to be maintained and if they find any errors in the code or filenaming and folder naming, it is my task to fix it in a timely matter so they can get to work.

#### M. Measurable:
Most of this effort will be shown throughout multiple jupyter notebooks specific to each teammate and their corresponding dataset. 

#### A. Achievable:
We keep in touch via a group chat on messenger. Any urgent messages or bugs can be made into a notification by using the "@" feature on messenger. This sends a direct notification to the receiver so they are aware of how urgent the message is.

#### R. Relevant:
The faster I can organize and produce data, the faster they can get to work.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/11/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific:
Update the wiki page!

#### M. Measurable:
The result of this effort will be shown by a wiki page on the master repo titled feature team.

#### A. Achievable:
The wiki page was already created and updating it isn't that hard.

#### R. Relevant:
Incase someone would like to dive deep into what we achieved or if I ever need to go back to review some aspects of the project.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 11/11/2018
