# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Ambiorix Cruz Angeles

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Being able to complete one full pipeline from the Feature Team -> Algorithm Team -> Evaluation Team. To be specific, creating a "control" model for comparison between future models. The result of this effort will be shown in the groups documentation file. A table of some sort listing all the future models, including this base model, will be made to keep track of important notes from each model. This is obtainable if everyone in the group puts forth there best effort when it's their teams turn to take over the current model being produced. This is relevant to our project because if we can get into a nice routine, the rest would just be changing the inputs and getting outputs.
Update: We have completed our stretch goal. Now all we have to do is compare and contrast different trained models.
