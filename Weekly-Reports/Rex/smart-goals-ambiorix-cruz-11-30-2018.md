# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Ambiorix Cruz Angeles
**Date:** 11/30/2018

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Being able to complete one full pipeline from the Feature Team -> Algorithm Team -> Evaluation Team. To be specific, creating a "control" model for comparison between future models. The result of this effort will be shown in the groups documentation file. A table of some sort listing all the future models, including this base model, will be made to keep track of important notes from each model. This is obtainable if everyone in the group puts forth there best effort when it's their teams turn to take over the current model being produced. This is relevant to our project because if we can get into a nice routine, the rest would just be changing the inputs and getting outputs.
Update: We have completed our stretch goal. Now all we have to do is compare and contrast different trained models.


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

1. Created slides for Brian's meeting.

2. Tresholded the radar data.

3. Rsync'd the tresholded radar data to wproj.

Week 14- S.M.A.R.T.- Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timebound

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific:
Creating slides that summarize our best results to show grossberg and brian.

#### M. Measurable: 
The result of this can be seen from the presentation we will be having.

#### A. Achievable:
We meet up with grossberg on a weekly basis, the bottleneck is finding a time for brian.

#### R. Relevant:
Having an overall view of the progress with two experts can help us get a better understanding of where we are and where we are heading.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 12/9/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:
Tresholding the radar data can set the png pixel value of 255 to 30 mm/hour so we can retain the information and have much better looking radar images.

#### M. Measurable:
The results of this effort can be shown in the jupyter notebook titled "radar" in the rex subfolder of the master repo.

#### A. Achievable:
The data is readily available and the pillow library can help with this along with numpy.

#### R. Relevant:
Tresholding the image can help retain information from the predicted images.

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 12/9/2018

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific:
Rsyncing the tresholded data onto wproj for sami to do his work.

#### M. Measurable:
~/scratch/sparseless2 is the directory on wproj that will contain all the new tresholded radar images.

#### A. Achievable:
I have rsync'd data before onto wproj.

#### R. Relevant:
This new dataset will allow us to create a new pix2pix model that may be better than the last

#### T. Time-bound:
This task should be done by next Sunday. 12/29/2018 

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

Smart Goal #1- "Talking with Sami so we can email Brian for a possible meetup." it was via email

Smart Goal #2- "Rsyncing the numpy files for satyam." ~scratch/satyam on wproj

Smart Goal #3- "Trying to help yuan with her vid2vid error."
